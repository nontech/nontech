## Intro
👋 Hi, I’m Mukesh from Nepal 🇳🇵, currently living in Berlin, Germany 🇩🇪 
- I code in Python, Elixir, & JavaScript (with Typescript)
- My current tech stack: Nextjs, React Native, Svelte & Supabase
- As part of my graduation project, I built [Project Luna](https://github.com/nontech/luna)
- My goal is to ship ONE side project every month of 2025. Inspired by the amazing [Marc Lou](https://marclou.com/)

### 2025 Side Projects
- January: [Project Luna](https://github.com/nontech/luna) (create, manage, and run Python exercises in-browser)
- February: [Urban Eats Club](https://github.com/nontech/uec_app) (invite-only mobile app - helping companies offer lunch experiences that boost employee satisfaction and office attendance)
- March: [Quell](https://github.com/nontech/quell) (discontinued - likely to be replaced by AI integrated into Google calendar)
- April: ❌ 
- May: [LuminFeed](https://github.com/amanjaiswal03/luminfeed) (AI-powered web app that helps creators, makers, and startups generate platform-specific organic content for their product with a click)
