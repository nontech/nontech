## Intro
👋 Hi, I’m Mukesh from Nepal, currently living in Berlin, Germany.
- 👀 I code in Python, Elixir, & JavaScript (with Typescript).
- My current tech stack: Nextjs, React Native, Svelte & Supabase
- 🌱 As part of my graduation project, I built [Project Luna](https://github.com/nontech/luna).
- 💞️ My goal is to ship ONE side project every month of 2025. Inspired by the amazing [Marc Lou](https://marclou.com/).

### Side Projects
- January: [Project Luna](https://github.com/nontech/luna)
- February: [Urban Eats Club](https://github.com/nontech/uec_app) (invite-only mobile app)
- March: [Quell](https://github.com/nontech/quell) (discontinued - likely to be replaced by AI integrated into Google calendar)
- April: None 
- May: [LuminFeed](https://github.com/amanjaiswal03/luminfeed)
