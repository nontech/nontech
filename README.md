- 👋 Hi, I’m Mukesh from Berlin, Germany.
- 👀 I code in Python, Elixir, & JavaScript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django by building an interactive web tool for teachers that will allow them to create custom Python exercises for their students called [Project Luna](https://github.com/nontech/luna).
- 💞️ My goal is to ship 5 side projects by 2024. Inspired by the amazing [Marc Lou](https://marclou.com/).
