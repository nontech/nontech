## Intro
👋 Hi, I’m Mukesh from Nepal, currently living in Berlin, Germany.
- 👀 I code in Python, Elixir, & JavaScript (with Typescript).
- My current tech stack: Nextjs, React Native, Svelte & Supabase
- 🌱 As part of my graduation project, I built [Project Luna](https://github.com/nontech/luna).
- 💞️ My goal is to ship 2 side projects every month by 2025. Inspired by the amazing [Marc Lou](https://marclou.com/).

### Monthly Projects
- January: [Project Luna](https://github.com/nontech/luna) & [Urban Eats Club](https://github.com/nontech/uec_app)
- February: [Quell](https://github.com/nontech/quell) & (... yet to decide)
